# Git Definitions

**Instructions: ** Define each of the following Git concepts.

* Version control is a way of "saving" or rather committing, every change made to code so that changes can be made to the same code by multiple parties, simultaneously, with out effecting each other.
* A branch is a small chunk of code with its roots in a master code.  The branch is essentially a  copy of the master code that can be worked on separately within this branch without effecting the master code.
* A commit saves your code. This is good practice to do often so you can revert back to previous versions of your code if need be.
* A merge conflict is when you try to merge new code into your current working files and something is incorrectly labeled or the new changes are incompatible.
