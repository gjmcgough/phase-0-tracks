What is a VPS?
- A VPS is a virtual OS you can access from a command line just like your own computer, except it is completely separate.  The main advantage of using a VPS is that if you break it then it doesnt hurt anything. 

Why is it a bad idea to run programs as root?
- Because it defeats the purpose of the security model in place. Applications are meant to be run from a user level not an administrative level.
