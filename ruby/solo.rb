# Design (as opposed to actually building) a class representing anything you like. (Please make it something we have at least heard of.) Whether you want to build a fire-breathing dragon, a dress, or a soccer ball, we hereby grant you the freedom to implement it. No matter what you design, your class must have:

# at least three attributes (using at least two data types) whose values will vary from instance to instance (example: age)
# at least three methods, at least one of which takes an argument
# You're welcome to creative about these: a dress can have a swish method, a soccer ball can have an inflatedness attribute, and ... we hope it's obvious what a fire-breathing dragon can do, but if not, you'll figure it out.

# Pseudocode your design as comments in phase-0-tracks/ruby/solo.rb.



# Create a class for Soul_train_party
	# Initialize method
		# instance variable @conductor
		# instance variable @year
		# instance variable @artist

	# Dance_line method
		# takes 1 random guys name and 1 random girls name from an array and has them dance the dance line together
	
	# Afro_sheen method
		# sprays afro sheen on any fro's in need

	# Emergency_call method
		# calls fire department if roof is on fire and calls ambuland if someone broke their ankle cuz of their platform shoes
