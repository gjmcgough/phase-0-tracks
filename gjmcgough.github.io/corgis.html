		Some may love their faces, some may love their little stubs they call legs, but undoubtedly the most common phrase that will be heard at this year's Corgi Con held in Ocean Beach, San Francisco is "Corgi butts drive me nuts!" Corgi's butts are by far their most featured feature, and I'm sure that'd be quite obvious if you looked at anyone's Instagram that will be at Corgi Con. Chalk this one up as another Instagram epidemic...
